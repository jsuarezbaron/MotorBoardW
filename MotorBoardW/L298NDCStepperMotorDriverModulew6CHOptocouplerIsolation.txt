【Product features】
The L298N drive module, using the original L298N chip of ST company, can directly drive two 3-24V DC motor speed and direction, but also can control 1 4 line 2 phase stepper motor.Using high-speed optocoupler isolation circuit, control signal of support for 5V or 3.3V voltage.

【The photoelectric isolation circuit】
Enable pins ( ENA, ENB ) high-speed optocoupler HCPL2630 isolation of PWM signal input, support PWM frequencies up to 10MHz. The IN1, IN2, IN3, IN4 use of PC817 photoelectric isolation, the motor drive part and a control signal is completely isolated. Includes PC817 Series High Density Mounting Type Photocoupler.
